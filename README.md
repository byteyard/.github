# ByteYard GitHub Issue Templates

**This repository is the central hub for all the global templates used in creating and managing GitHub issues across all ByteYard project repositories.**

Our templates are designed to standardize the way we
handle issues, ensuring consistency and clarity in our
project management.

## Public GitHub Organization Homepage

In addition to the issue templates, this repository also
hosts the **Public GitHub Organization Homepage** README.md,
visible to GitHub users without organization access. This
README.md, editable under `./profile/README.md`, provides
a succinct overview of ByteYard, a digital agency
specializing in web development, design, and consulting.

## Global Project Issue Templates

Our templates are not just a random collection; they
follow a specific order that mirrors our agile development
workflow. Each template corresponds to a stage in our
process, guiding the project from inception to completion.
Here's how they fit into our workflow:
