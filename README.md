## Usage

This repository is a special ".github" repository. It contains global templates that are automatically inherited by all other repositories in the ByteYard organization that do not have their own templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

To use these templates in your project, simply copy the desired template file into the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory of your repository. When creating a new issue, you will be able to choose from these templates.

For more information about GitHub templates, please refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to these templates. If you have a suggestion for improvement, please open an issue using the appropriate template.
