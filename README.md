# ByteYard GitHub Issue Templates

This repository is the central hub for all the global
templates used in creating and managing GitHub issues
across all ByteYard project repositories. 

**Our templates are designed to standardize the way we
handle issues, ensuring consistency and clarity in our
project management.**

## Public GitHub Organization Homepage

In addition to the issue templates, this repository also
hosts the public GitHub Organization Homepage README.md,
visible to GitHub users without organization access. This
README.md, editable under `./profile/README.md`, provides
a succinct overview of ByteYard, a digital agency
specializing in web development, design, and consulting.

## Global Project Issue Templates

Our templates are not just a random collection; they
follow a specific order that mirrors our agile development
workflow. Each template corresponds to a stage in our
process, guiding the project from inception to completion.
Here's how they fit into our workflow:

### 1. [Project Management](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01%20Project%20Management.yml):

**This is where it all begins.**

This template is used for project-related tasks, including planning, tracking, and
management. It sets the stage for everything that follows.

### 2. [Documentation](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/09%20Documentation.yml):

**Documentation is a crucial part of our process.**

This template is used for tasks related to the creation or
update of documentation, ensuring we have all the
information we need to proceed.

This repository is a special ".github" repository. It
contains global templates that are automatically inherited
by all other repositories in the ByteYard organization
that do not have their own templates under
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
